# Low-coverage whole genome sequence processing pipeline
This pipeline is still in the process of being constructed as I make my way through pre and post-processing of genomic data.
A step-by-step computational pipeline for processing low-coverage whole genome sequences.

This pipeline is based on the work done by the Therkildsen Lab (https://github.com/therkildsen-lab), Nina Overgaard Therkildsen (https://github.com/nt246), and Nicolas Lou (https://github.com/nicolas931010) from the following repositories:
